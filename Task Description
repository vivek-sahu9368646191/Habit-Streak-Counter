This project is a Daily Habit Tracker with multi-user support, allowing users to sign up/log
in and manage their individual habits. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it features
a signup page for user authentication, a habit tracker interface to add, complete, reset, and
remove habits, and local storage to persist user data. To run the project, simply save the HTML(as new.html and auth.html),
CSS (as new.css), and JavaScript files (as new.js and auth.js) in the same directory, open auth.html
in a web browser, and use the signup/login functionality to access and manage your habits.
