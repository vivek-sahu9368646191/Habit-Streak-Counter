This Daily Habit Tracker allows users to add, track, and manage their daily habits, marking them as completed, resetting streaks, or removing them.
It maintains habit streaks, checks for missed days, and includes a progress bar to visualize completion status, with data stored in localStorage for persistence.
To run the project, download or clone the repository, then open the index.html file in a modern web browser. Modify styles in styles.css and functionality in script.js as needed. 
The tracker works best on modern browsers with JavaScript enabled, requiring no additional dependencies or backend setup.
